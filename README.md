# Bouncing-Ball-with-Blocks

Created a program that essentially extends from Princeton's BouncingBall.java. The program has a required argument of how many blocks, N, and a optional argument, -d, that causes the blocks to disappear when the ball touches them. Improved on the bugs and added the feature to click on the screen and add blocks to the screen. This turns it into more of a game play.
